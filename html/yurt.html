        <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
        <p>
          Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each
          yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
        </p>

        <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
        <p>
          Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired
          stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink
          with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
          located in the lodge.
        </p>

        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
        <p>
          Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack
          comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with
          layers of clothing.
        </p>
